			<p>I am a 27 year old artist/designer from Niagara Falls, ON, but currently reside in Ottawa.</p><p>I was initially trained in the field of Fine Arts and once completing by degree from <em>Brock University</em>, I decided to dive into the design world and attempt to move my work from canvas to computer.</p>
			<p> As an artist my personal work focuses on creations made by the hand and later developed by the machine. I enjoy utilizing illustration to my advantage because it allows me to embrace the irregular pencil lines, brush strokes, or anything that emulates the human presence. I have always been intrigued by the concept of what determines value, and how valuable a product is when it is produced by the hand or by machine.</p><p>I am intrigued by design as a whole, how concepts are devloped and how they are delivered, the boundaries that are pushed, and the constant evolution of what is trending. I became a designer to continue to learn and create things in new ways.</p>
