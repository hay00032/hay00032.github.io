I enjoy finding repetition and reflection in mass produced objects. A local tea store specializes in herbal teas has an arracy of vibrant tea tins around the shop which I thought would make a very eye catching piece. This work is nearly complete and soon to be displayed in the oringinal tea shop where the photograph was taken.
